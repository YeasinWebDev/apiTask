 ## Brief Explanation of Your Approach
 The `UserBoard` component is designed to display a list of users fetched from the JSONPlaceholder API 
    
   1) User Fetching: Users are fetched from the API when the component mounts.

   2)  Form Handling: A form is provided for submitting a new post with user details, and upon submission, the data is sent to the API.

   3) Comments Display: Comments related to each user can be viewed in a modal.
